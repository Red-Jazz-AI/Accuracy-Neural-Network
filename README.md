#  Accuracy Neural Network AI
Simple Project that sends back the accuracy of the ai after training it.

# PyTorch
PyTorch is a fully featured framework for building deep learning models,
which is a type of machine learning that's commonly used in applications like image recognition and language processing.
Written in Python, it's relatively easy for most machine learning developers to learn and use.


# Installation 
* Go to [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and you should see a installation area, simply choose the settings that fit you best, and use the pip command that is given.
* Then clone this repository or download it.

# Usage
not complicated and requires no setup.
just run this command to run the file
```bash
py main.py
```

# Expected Results

```bash
Checking accuracy on traning data
Got 59337 / 60000 with accuarcy 98.89
Checking accuracy on test data
Got 9724 / 10000 with accuarcy 97.24
```

>These numbers are not fixed and will never be the same.

# Modifications

The only thing i recommend for begineers to play around with is the
`num_epochs` variable, increase/decrease and it will affect the accuracy
